# drive_ml
This is the repository for our Machine Learning applications. 

# Install
1. Install [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) or ask project leader to create an account on TUM Phoenix Workstation
2. Install [requiremts](https://github.com/tum-phoenix/drive_ml/blob/master/GTSRB_python/requirements.txt) (not needed if using Phoenix Workstation)
3. Download GTRSB dataset (?)


To load the GTSRB dataset correctly in the jupyter notebook, please extract the file at the same level as your ml repo, so you should have something like:
`../drive_ml`

`../GTSRB/Final_Training/..`

A cell can also do this for you.
