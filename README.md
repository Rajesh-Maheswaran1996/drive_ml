# drive_ml
This is the repository for our Machine Learning applications. 

To load the GTSRB dataset correctly in the jupyter notebook, please extract the file at the same level as your ml repo, so you should have something like:

../drive_ml

../GTSRB/Final_Training/..

A cell can also do this for you.
